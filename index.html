				<p>Realise that none of us are perfect (mentally, physically or spiritually), and also that none of us are in an
					ideal situation in life.</p>
				<p>Of course it is not fair that some people do not have to worry about their finances, or finding a lover, having
					a family etc. However there are always people who are worse off than you and even those who you think have
					everything, they have problems that you may not have even contemplated.</p>
				<p>You may complain about not having a lover, a family and being solitary. However you may be healthy and full of
					vitality; intelligent and creative. Try to acknowledge the good things that you already possess.</p>
				<p>Do not complain about what you do or do not have. Realise that lack of something in your life may in
					fact make it fuller.</p>
				<p>You cannot put more water into a cup that is already full.</p>
				<p>Be content with what you have. Do not hope for something better, and do not worry about things that you do not have.</p>
				<p>It has all to do with perceiving all experiences relatively, and acknowledging the vast multidimensionality of
					our existence.</p>
				<p>Essentially, human beings suffer because we think that we lack something that can make us happy. Hence a human
					being is never satisfied as long as we associate our happiness with that which is external to us and acquirable.</p>
				<p>We should not seek for happiness or significance at all. Ideals that we seek for, does not exist. Our suffering
					originates from the act of seeking itself.</p>
				<p>There is no meaning in life, but ironically once you stop searching for the meaning of life; it actually becomes
					significant. Since you do not seek, you are able to sense and fulfil more out your present experiences.</p>
				<p>Meaning of life is to be free from having a meaning. To seek for no significance in life, one simply fulfils the
					most out of the being that one is.</p>
